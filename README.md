# BTree implementation for C#

![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CodeExMachina/BTree.svg?branch=master)

This package provides an in-memory B-Tree implementation for C#, useful as
an ordered, mutable data structure.

The code and api are inspired by Google's excellent [Go implementation](https://github.com/google/btree).
